### Introduction
The bow hold is essential to all string players. For a musician to bring out the full potential of their instrument they should have the proper form. Without the support of a technically sound bow hold, musicians could limit their practice time and risk wrist injury. String players often take a while to develop the correct foundation without the help of an experienced musician or coach. By eliminating the need for frequent supervision, string players can expedite their learning and focus on other technical skills. Using an implementation of the YOLO algorithm, my Cello Bow Hold App takes in videos or images of a musician and returns whether their bow hold is correct or incorrect.
